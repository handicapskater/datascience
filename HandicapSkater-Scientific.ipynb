    "# üî¨ Scientific Proof of Pain from Walking vs Skating\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates, using biometric data and statistical analysis, that walking causes measurable cardiovascular stress due to pain, while skating enables extended mobility with less physiological strain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Prove that inline skating is a medically necessary mobility aid by analyzing:\n",
    "- Heart Rate Variability (HRV)\n",
    "- Time in HR Zones 4‚Äì5 (e.g. 156-167 bpm, 168-180 bpm)\n",
    "- Distance and duration of activity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**:\n",
    "- Use biometric time-series data\n",
    "- Apply statistical and ML algorithms\n",
    "- Compare walking vs skating metrics visually and numerically\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**:\n",
    "Walking, even for short periods, produces pain-induced cardiovascular responses (PICE), while skating permits long-distance, low-stress ambulation.\n"
